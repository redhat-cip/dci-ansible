I will create a new trello card to push this further. So I am removing my -1 for this.\n\nNonetheless, I still have one question: How can name be empty?\nIf you don\u0027t specify name in the task description, result._task.get_name() will return result._task.action that is *always* defined[1]\n\n[1] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/playbook/task.py#L108-L119",
